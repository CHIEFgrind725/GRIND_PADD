GRIND is more than a meme. It’s a movement.

## 🛡️ DHI: Decentralized Heuristic Integrity

**GRIND introduces a new layer of protection: DHI.**  
It’s a smart protocol-level guard system built to shield users from exploiters, rug pulls, and market manipulation.

### Features:
- **Born-On Token DNA:** Every token carries a unique serial stamp.  
- **Wallet Behavior Scanner:** Flags unusual trade patterns and bot behavior.  
- **Freeze Protocol:** Suspect wallets are auto-paused for review and DAO vote.  
- **DAO Defense Shield:** Stakeholders ($1K+ in GRIND) vote on unlocks or blacklists.

> Protected by GRIND’s custom-built DHI system — where transparency meets accountability.
