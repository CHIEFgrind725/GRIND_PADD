## 🛠️ Supported Versions

| Version  | Status              |
|----------|---------------------|
| Current  | ✅ Actively Monitored |
| Older    | ❌ Unsupported        |
| Cloned   | ☠️ Not Authorized     |

## 🚨 Reporting a Vulnerability or Clone

If you discover a **bug**, **exploit**, or **unauthorized clone**, please report it to our team:

📧 Email: `grindtoken@proton.me`  
🔒 Subject Line: `SECURITY ALERT - [Brief Description]`

You can also open a private issue here on GitHub and tag it as `security`.

### ⏱️ Response Time
We take every report seriously and aim to respond within **24–48 hours**.  
If urgent, escalate through multiple channels (GitHub + Email).

---

## 🧬 Known Impostors

We are aware of ongoing attempts to clone GRIND.  
A public **Wall of Shame** will be maintained listing verified impostors and their wallet/contract details.  
Use extreme caution when interacting with any GRIND-like token not listed in our official documentation.

---

## 🧠 Reminder

> GRIND isn't just a token — it's a symbol of sweat equity, relentless pursuit, and verified authenticity.  
> **If it ain’t on the GRIND contract, it ain’t GRIND.**
Want me to drop this into your repo and commit it for you, or do you want to copy/paste it in now?

Also — want to set up that Wall of Shame.md file next? 👀
